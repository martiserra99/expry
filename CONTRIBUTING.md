# Contributing to Expry

Hi there! We're so glad you're interested in contributing to Expry üòÅ. Your involvement helps us grow and improve ‚Äî thank you for considering joining our journey!

Expry currently provides the following packages:

- **@expry/system**: Contains all the core functionality of Expry to map JSON to JavaScript code.

- **@expry/basic**: Contains basic operations that can be included when using the core package.

- **@expry/formity**: Contains Formity operations that can be included when using the core package.

If you want to contribute you can add new operators to either **@expry/basic** or **@expry/formity**. Additionally, if you want to create any other package feel free to do so. A package for validation rules with Zod would be a great package to have for example!

Have ideas for new features or ways to enhance Expry? Awesome! You can reach out to us anytime at [contact@martiserra.me](mailto:contact@martiserra.me). And if you're ready to dive in, feel free to submit a pull request - we're always happy to review contributions from the community.

Thank you for making Expry better with your support. We can't wait to see what we build together!
